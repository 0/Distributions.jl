Distributions.jl
================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl)

A Julia package for probability distributions and associated functions. Particularly, Distributions implements:

* Moments (e.g mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis), entropy, and other properties
* Probability density/mass functions (pdf) and their logarithm (logpdf)
* Moment generating functions and characteristic functions
* Sampling from population or from a distribution
* Maximum likelihood estimation
* Posterior w.r.t. conjugate prior, and Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP) estimation

Please refer to the [Package Documentation](http://distributionsjl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for details.
